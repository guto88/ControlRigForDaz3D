# Control Rig For Daz3D (works with male and female figures based on the Genesis 8/8.1 Skeleton).

# How To:

1) To use this control-rig, you need to import your mesh with the setting "Fix bone rotations on import" enabled. http://davidvodhanel.com/daz-to-unreal-fix-bone-rotations-option/

2) Copy the file FemaleBase_Animation_CtrlRig from the folder Control-Rig OptionA to your project folder. Open the file and change the preview mesh to your mesh imported with the option fix bone rotations on import enabled. Hit compile and save. Read the instructions that I've left inside the file FemaleBase_Animation_CtrlRig.

3) Drag and drop the file FemaleBase_Animation_CtrlRig to your viewport.
